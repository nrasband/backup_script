Description:

    This is a simple backup script. It can be used to backup folders 
    (including nested folders) as well as individual files. It currently
    does not compress files, although that would be a logical addition
    which I may add at some point.

Supported platforms:

    This script works on Windows, Mac, and Linux.

Instructions for use:

    Simply add all of the folders and files that you want to backup
    into backup_folders.txt (one per line) and change 
    BACKUP_PATH to point to the location to which you want to save the files.
